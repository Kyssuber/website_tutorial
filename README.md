# Using Python to generate HTML files to display Galaxy Images and Data!

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook and PDF guide for creating a locally-hosted HTML website.  While the tutorial is intended for research students in the KU Galaxy Evolution group, the instructions should be generalizable to nearly all applications (hopefully of the scientific kind). Some prior knowledge of Python, astropy, and matplotlib will be particularly helpful. 

See the requirements.txt file for the package and version dependencies, should you choose to follow the notebook verbatim.

All are welcome to report issues here if any problems or troubleshooting needs arise.
